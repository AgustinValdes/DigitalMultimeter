# DigitalMultimeter

Starting with the first label, we have the numeric output itself. I
opted for a four-digit display to keep the form factor as small as
possible. The idea was to have it be a hand-held device for quick
measurements.
Users switch between measuring voltage, amperage, and
resistance by pressing on the red, green, and blue buttons
(labeled #2). Switching between modes will also change the
indicator LED (#6) to the appropriate color.
Labels #3 and #4 describe the probes that come out of the
multimeter, such that #3 is responsible for voltage, while #4 is
responsible for resistance. By gathering both voltage and
resistance, the multimeter can calculate amperage through Ohm's
Law.
Label 5 refers to the microcontroller itself, an Arduino Nano. This
decision ties to the goal of keeping the multimeter as minimalistic
as possible.
Lastly, labels #8 and #7 are examples of nodes that could be
tested using the multimeter's probes. Any electrical connection
on a breadboard is fair game!
